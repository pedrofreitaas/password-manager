# Passwrord-manager
A simple password manager . It storages the passwords in a file inside the passwords directory, created by the software. It uses a symple cryptography method that makes 
the passwords a little bit secure.

RGP = Randomly generated passwords.

Features:

-> Can create and store random passwords for any hypothetical purpose.

-> Is based in a master password that is created by the user.

-> Stores all the passwords encrypted in a file that is difficult to read.

-> The user can change the configs of the program, such as: RGP length, RGP possible characters.

-> Any problems with the master key restarts the program data, so all the passwords are lost, because they must not be used if the master key is lost, or broken somehow.
